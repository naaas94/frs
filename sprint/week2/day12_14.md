# Days 12-14: Stabilization

## Goal for Final Days
Repeat the same pattern types until solving feels automatic.

**Stop condition**: Medium solved in 30-35 min with correct code + passing tests.

---

## Daily Structure

### Each Day (90 min)
1. **Warm-up** (10 min): Template from memory + yesterday's micro-drill
2. **Timed problem** (35 min): Random medium from problem bank
3. **Review + Postmortem** (15 min)
4. **Second problem OR plumbing** (30 min)

---

## Problem Selection

By now you should rotate through all patterns:
- Day 12: Hashmap + Binary Search
- Day 13: Graph + Sorting
- Day 14: Two Pointers + Heap

Or focus on any that still feel shaky.

## Final Checklist

Before your actual interview, confirm:

### Pattern Recognition (< 30 sec each)
- [ ] Hashmap: counting, grouping, complement
- [ ] Two Pointers: sorted array, sliding window
- [ ] Sorting: intervals, custom keys
- [ ] Heap: top-k, merge streams
- [ ] Binary Search: boundaries, rotated
- [ ] BFS/DFS: connected components, shortest path

### Execution Protocol (automatic)
- [ ] 2 min: Restate + pattern
- [ ] 2 min: Test cases first
- [ ] Baseline prompt at minute 4
- [ ] Invariant prompt at minute 10
- [ ] Clean up + edge cases

### Stress Interrupts (reflexes)
- [ ] Freeze → "Baseline first"
- [ ] Confused → "State the invariant"

### Plumbing Pipeline (< 30 min)
- [ ] parse → validate → normalize → aggregate → select → report

---

## Day 14: Final Mock

Run one more mock with these additional constraints:
- Treat it as THE interview
- Full 45 minutes
- Debrief as if it counted

### Post-Sprint Reflection

1. What was your biggest improvement?
2. What's your go-to pattern now?
3. What would you drill more with more time?

---

## You're Ready

If you can:
- Recognize patterns in < 30 seconds
- Write templates from memory
- Solve mediums in 30-35 minutes
- Handle edge cases systematically
- Stay calm when stuck (baseline, invariant)

Then you have the skills. Trust the preparation.

Good luck! 🎯
