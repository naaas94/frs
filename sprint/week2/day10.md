# Day 10: Patch Weakest Pattern (Continued)

## Today's Goal
Continue targeted practice until your weak pattern feels automatic.

---

## Morning Check-In

Yesterday's confidence level (1-5): ___

If < 4: Continue with same pattern
If >= 4: Move to second weakest pattern

---

## Practice Structure

### Option A: Same Pattern (if still weak)

1. **Warm-up** (10 min): Write the template from memory
2. **Timed problem** (35 min): New problem, interview conditions
3. **Review** (15 min): Compare to optimal, postmortem

### Option B: Second Pattern (if first is solid)

1. **Review notebook** (15 min)
2. **Two problems** (60 min): One easy, one medium
3. **Create fix rule** (15 min)

---

## Pattern Automaticity Test

Can you:
- [ ] Recognize when this pattern applies in < 30 seconds?
- [ ] Write the template structure without looking?
- [ ] State the invariant clearly?
- [ ] Handle the common edge cases automatically?

If YES to all → pattern is automated.
If NO to any → keep drilling.
