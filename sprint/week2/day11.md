# Day 11: Full Mock Interview #2

## Today's Goal
Second mock. Measure improvement since Day 8.

## Pre-Mock Prep

Quick mental review (5 min):
- Your execution protocol (2 min restate, 2 min tests, baseline, invariant...)
- Your two interrupts ("Baseline first", "State invariant")
- Your fix rules for common bugs

## Mock Session (45 min)

Run: `python -m cli.mock`

Same rules as Day 8:
- No notes
- Talk aloud
- Follow the protocol
- Tests first
